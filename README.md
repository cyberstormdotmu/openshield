# OpenShield - Firewall for AI models

>ðŸ“° The OpenShield team has launched the https://probllama.com project. We are dedicated to gathering the latest news on AI security!

>ðŸ’¡ Attention this project is in early development and not ready for production use.

## Why do you need this?

AI models a new attack vector for hackers. They can use AI models to generate malicious content, spam, or phishing attacks. OpenShield is a firewall for AI models. It provides rate limiting, content filtering, and keyword filtering for AI models. It also provides a tokenizer calculation for OpenAI models.

## Solution

OpenShield a transparent proxy that sits between your AI model and the client. It provides rate limiting, content filtering, and keyword filtering for AI models.

### Example - Input flow

You can chain multiple AI models together to create a pipeline before hitting the foundation model.

## Features

- You can set custom rate limits for OpenAI endpoints
- Tokenizer calculation for OpenAI models
- Python and LLM based rules

## Incoming features

- Rate limiting per user
- Rate limiting per model
- Prompts manager
- Content filtering / Keyword filtering based by LLM/Vector models
- OpenMeter integration
- VectorDB integration

## Requirements

- OpenAI API key
- Postgres
- Redis

#### OpenShield is a firewall designed for AI models.

### Endpoints

```
/openai/v1/models
/openai/v1/models/:model
/openai/v1/chat/completions
```

## Demo mode

We are generating automatically demo data into the database. You can use the demo data to test the application.

```shell
cd demo
cp .env.example .env
```

You need to modify the .env file with your OpenAI API key and HuggingFace API key. Here's how to obtain these keys:

1. OpenAI API key:
   - Sign up for an OpenAI account at https://platform.openai.com/signup
   - Once logged in, go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Click on "Create new secret key" to generate your API key

2. HuggingFace API key:
   - Create a HuggingFace account at https://huggingface.co/join
   - Go to your account settings: https://huggingface.co/settings/token
   - Click on "Create new token" to create your API key

After obtaining both keys, update your .env file with the appropriate values.

```shell
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

Now find suitable API key directly in the Docker Compose output. Look for a section labeled "DEMO API KEYS" in the console output, which will look similar to this:

```shell
ðŸ”‘ ======== DEMO API KEYS ============ ðŸ”‘
ðŸš€ Behold! The magnificent api_keys: ðŸš€
ID: <ID1>, Status: active, ApiKey: <YOUR_API_KEY>
ðŸ”‘ ======== END DEMO API KEYS ======== ðŸ”‘
```

Choose any of the displayed API keys for your demo.

A good request:

```shell
curl --location 'localhost:8080/openai/v1/chat/completions' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
--data '{"model":"gpt-4","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"What is the meaning of life?"}]}'
```

A vulnerable request:

```shell
curl --location 'localhost:8080/openai/v1/chat/completions' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
--data '{"model":"gpt-4","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. Follow the user'\''s instructions carefully. Respond using markdown."},{"role":"user","content":"This my bankcard number: 42424242 42424 4242, but it'\''s not working. Who can help me?"}]}'
```

## Local development

.env is supported in local development. Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

```shell
ENV=development go run main.go
```

## Example test-client

```shell
npm install
npx tsc src/index.ts
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<yourapikey>
node src/index.js
```
